üìä End-to-End Data Engineering Project: Databricks End to End Project

üöÄ Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive, end-to-end data engineering solution built on Azure Databricks with a strong focus on modern data architecture principles and advanced processing techniques. It demonstrates the entire lifecycle of data, from raw ingestion to refined, analytical-ready formats, leveraging Databricks' capabilities for scalable processing and Azure's robust cloud infrastructure.

The primary objective was to establish a reliable and efficient data platform that supports unified customer analytics, streamlined claims processing, enhanced reporting for financial analysis by transforming disparate source data into actionable insights.

üéØ Problem Statement(s) Addressed
This solution tackles the following key problems prevalent in the insurance sector:

Fragmented Data Landscape: Data scattered across various legacy systems (policy admin, claims, CRM, etc.) hindering a unified view of customers and operations.

Inefficient Data Processing: Manual and batch-oriented processes leading to delays in claims handling, policy updates, and reporting.

Lack of Actionable Insights: Difficulty in leveraging vast amounts of data for predictive analytics, real-time monitoring, and strategic planning.


‚ú® Solution Highlights & Advanced Features

The project implements a modern medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) to ensure data quality, scalability, and usability, incorporating advanced data engineering patterns:

Automated Data Ingestion: Established reliable pipelines for incremental data ingestion from diverse sources into a centralized data lake, ensuring data freshness and efficiency.
Robust ETL/ELT Pipelines: Developed scalable transformations using Delta Live Tables (DLT) to clean, enrich, and conform raw data into analytical-ready formats. This includes:
Implementation of SCD Type 1 (SCD-1) for handling changing attributes where only the latest value is kept (e.g., product price updates).
Implementation of SCD Type 2 (SCD-2) for tracking historical changes of dimension attributes (e.g., customer address changes), providing full historical context.
Streaming Data Capabilities: Utilized streaming tables and streaming views within DLT to process data with near real-time latency, enabling faster insights and decision-making.
Unified Data Models (Star Schema): Created comprehensive data models in the Gold layer adhering to a Star Schema design for optimized analytical queries.
Gold_Orders acts as the Fact table, containing metrics and foreign keys to dimension tables.
Gold_Customers and Gold_Products serve as Dimension tables, holding descriptive attributes.
Parametrized Data Ingestion: Implemented parametrization using Databricks widgets to dynamically ingest data into the Bronze layer, enhancing pipeline flexibility and reusability.
Analytical Data Store: Built an optimized Gold layer for efficient querying and reporting.
Customer Churn Prediction Integration: Leveraged advanced analytics to identify patterns and provide proactive insights. 

üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The solution leverages a suite of Azure services, following best practices for cloud-native data platforms, with a strong emphasis on Databricks' Delta Live Tables for pipeline orchestration and management.

Key Azure Services Used:

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2): Scalable and secure data lake for raw, semi-processed, and refined data storage across Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
Azure Data Factory (ADF): (Potentially for orchestrating DLT pipelines or initial data loading into ADLS Gen2).
Azure Databricks: The core Apache Spark-based analytics platform. This project heavily utilizes:
Delta Live Tables (DLT): For declarative, reliable, and scalable ETL/ELT pipelines, managing streaming and batch workloads.
Streaming Tables & Streaming Views: Built within DLT to handle continuous data flows.
Unity Catalog: For centralized data governance, metadata management, and fine-grained access control across all data assets.

üíª Notebooks Overview

The Notebooks/ directory contains the core logic for the data pipelines, structured by the Medallion Layers and highlighting specific implementation patterns:

bronze_layer_notebook.py: Handles the initial ingestion of raw data files from the Datasets/ directory into the Bronze layer of ADLS Gen2. This notebook demonstrates parametrization using dbutils.widgets for dynamic source selection.
Silver_Customers.py: A DLT pipeline (or notebook code for it) responsible for taking customer data from the Bronze layer, cleaning it, and applying SCD Type 1 (SCD-1) logic for dimension updates in the Silver layer.
Silver_Orders.py: A DLT pipeline (or notebook code for it) focused on ingesting order data from Bronze to Silver, implementing an incremental data load strategy to process only new or changed records efficiently. This might utilize streaming tables.
Silver_Products.py: A DLT pipeline (or notebook code for it) for processing product data from Bronze to Silver, incorporating SCD Type 2 (SCD-2) to maintain a full history of product attribute changes.
Silver_Region.py: (If applicable) A DLT pipeline (or notebook code for it) for processing regional data to the Silver layer.
Gold_Customers.py: A DLT pipeline (or notebook code for it) that curates and transforms customer data from the Silver layer into the Gold layer's Gold_Customers dimension table for analytical use.
Gold_Orders.py: A DLT pipeline (or notebook code for it) that aggregates and transforms order data from the Silver layer into the Gold layer's Gold_Orders fact table, serving as the central point for order-related metrics.
